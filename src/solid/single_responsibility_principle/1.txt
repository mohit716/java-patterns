SOLID — S = Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

A class (or module) should have only one reason to change.
In other words: one job, one responsibility.

Example of violation: A class that both saves a report to a file AND sends it by email AND validates the data. If file format, email API, or validation rules change, the same class changes for three different reasons.

Example of SRP: Separate classes — ReportValidator, ReportFileWriter, ReportEmailSender. Each has one reason to change.
